# Interoperability corpus

This corpus makes disagreements between independent ATIF implementations reproducible and inspectable. It is deliberately small, synthetic, and source-grounded.

The purpose of this corpus is not to prove that Agent Session Bridge is correct; it is to make disagreements between independent implementations reproducible and inspectable.

## Contents

- `fixtures/interoperability/claude-comprehensive.source.jsonl` is the canonical synthetic Claude Code-shaped source. It contains ordinary text, two tool calls in one assistant turn, results that arrive out of order and non-adjacently, timestamps, structured arguments/results, one unsupported `thinking` block, two unsupported source records (`system/init` and `progress`), an intentionally ignored debug field, and obviously fake secret-like values.
- `fixtures/interoperability/expected-semantics.json` is the semantic oracle. It separates source facts, ASB policy, comparison policy, and ATIF limitations. It does not require generated metadata or JSON serialization to match.
- `src/interoperability/verifier.py` validates ATIF structure and classifies semantic checks as `PRESERVED`, `NORMALIZED`, `DEGRADED`, `OMITTED`, `CONFLICT`, or `NOT_APPLICABLE`.
- `tests/test_interoperability_verifier.py` tests the verifier itself with adversarial mutations.

## Reproduce and verify

From a clean checkout with the development dependencies installed:

```powershell
python -m interoperability.reproduce `
  --source fixtures/interoperability/claude-comprehensive.source.jsonl `
  --output work/claude-comprehensive.atif.json
python -m interoperability.verifier `
  --source fixtures/interoperability/claude-comprehensive.source.jsonl `
  --output work/claude-comprehensive.atif.json `
  --oracle fixtures/interoperability/expected-semantics.json
```

The equivalent POSIX command uses `\` for line continuation. The generated artifact includes ASB's conversion timestamp, so byte equality is intentionally not the contract. The verifier compares source-grounded semantics and reports the volatile metadata boundary explicitly.

The compact CI-equivalent check is:

```text
python -m pytest -q
python -m ruff check .
python -m mypy --namespace-packages --explicit-package-bases src
```

The CI workflow runs the reproduction and verifier after those checks.

## ATIF v1.8 compatibility result

The published PyPI `atif` distribution currently exposes `1.7.0` only. ASB therefore remains declared as `atif>=1.7,<1.8` and continues to emit `ATIF-v1.7`. Installing ASB with a normal resolver cannot select ATIF v1.8: it fails because the package bound excludes v1.8, and the package index currently has no `atif==1.8` release to install.

The current Harbor ATIF implementation at commit `d6514c49e3dc321df46c6653cb3ee8166ab12efe` empirically validated the generated ASB artifact as both `ATIF-v1.7` and, after changing only the schema-version label, `ATIF-v1.8`; both retained five steps. Harbor's v1.8 model also accepts the new `audio` content part, while the installed ATIF 1.7.0 model accepts only `text` and `image` content parts and rejects audio. ASB has no Claude source audio mapping and correctly does not claim to emit v1.8 audio.

Decision: do not widen the dependency or migrate the emitted schema in this sprint. The v1.7 behavior is compatible with the current v1.8 reference model for the fields ASB uses, but v1.8's new audio surface needs an intentional source/mapping design and a released dependency before migration. This is compatibility evidence, not a claim of universal ATIF v1.8 support.

## Comparison model

An independent implementation may serialize different IDs, metadata, extensions, optional fields, or formatting while preserving equivalent trajectory facts. The comparison categories mean:

- `PRESERVED`: the source fact survives without semantic change.
- `NORMALIZED`: the representation changes while the source meaning and relationship survive, such as moving a later Claude `tool_result` into an ATIF observation.
- `DEGRADED`: the source includes material outside the supported representation and the loss is explicitly accounted for.
- `OMITTED`: the source or field is intentionally not emitted, such as the provider-only debug field or a tool-result timestamp that ATIF v1.7 cannot represent.
- `CONFLICT`: the candidate output contradicts a source fact or an explicitly tested policy.
- `NOT_APPLICABLE`: an ASB-specific policy is not imposed on a peer implementation.

ASB is not the reference authority. The source facts and the ATIF contract are the authority for portable semantics; redaction defaults, extension layout, generated metadata, and result-only-record presentation remain implementation-defined unless the format requires otherwise.

## Peer comparison matrix

The following results were run from the canonical source at SHA-256 `4FD858F21F934568FB49E12CD8C9595A82791EE66F73AE011DC2DC414E835D90`. The semantic oracle SHA-256 is `7998B39A3957D1F0D3EED4991E5AC94B5377CBB2D4C4C3B899DD53C9EF61D5AC`. The ASB artifact was generated with the reproduction command above; peer outputs were kept outside this repository.

| Implementation | Tested provenance | Experiment and command | Observed result | Classification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Agent Session Bridge | `cb360a8`; `atif 1.7.0` | `python -m interoperability.reproduce ...` then `python -m interoperability.verifier ...` | Five steps, two calls, two correlated results, source step timestamps, and redaction passed; one unsupported block and two unsupported records were accounted for. | ASB self-validation |
| `eddiechu888/agent-trajectory-store` | `7d62fe94c96c4c2ebb93506e4e9d8591f928fce4`; package `0.1.1` | `ClaudeAdapter().convert(AdapterInput(...))`; verifier with `--implementation agent-trajectory-store` | Five steps and two calls/results preserved. Result JSON key order and multiline whitespace normalized; no default redaction and no ASB fidelity extension. | Equivalent semantics plus intentional policy difference; verifier passed |
| `davanstrien/agent-traces` | `63df6415bdd651c49d66f161665e000c5c6d94f2`; package `0.1.0` | `parse_sessions(canonical.source.jsonl)` and `parse_sessions(canonical.atif.json)` | Direct Claude parsing returned eight flat source rows and exposed thinking text. The ATIF path expects legacy `{"lines": [...]}` documents; the ASB root `steps` artifact was not recognized and triggered a scalar-detection `TypeError`. | ATIF shape incompatibility / peer defect candidate; not an ASB conformance failure |
| `waldekmastykarz/atifact` | `db0bf0fcac29adc26778185383d42f2d7c8ceba6`; package `0.12.1` | `node dist/src/index.js canonical.source.jsonl --format claude-code-jsonl --json --quiet`; verifier with `--implementation atifact` | Output was valid ATIF v1.7 with four steps, two calls, and one result. It omitted the delayed second result and adjacent user text after its pending tool step had already flushed; it also omitted source timestamps. | Differential conflict requiring source-format/implementation triage; no upstream change made |
| `Eli-Chandler/atif-lens` | `78a8a247bdd9cae30897134f22864b6d1d3c9733`; package `0.2.0` | `npm ci --ignore-scripts`; existing web tests plus a temporary local `parseTrajectory`/`lintTrajectory` test against the ASB artifact | Existing 23 tests passed; the ASB artifact parsed and linted with zero warnings. | Independent parser/linter agreement |
| `theagenticguy/atif-sql` | `5793d935bfb0117994ba04c75125151ba805598c`; workspace source inspected | `python -m pip install -e <peer> --quiet` was bounded and stopped while resolving its dependency graph; conversion was not run. | No conversion result collected. | NOT TESTED; source indicates Claude-to-ATIF conversion is backed by a pinned Harbor adapter |

The peer commands are intentionally not CI dependencies. They are reproducibility notes for the captured local experiments, not claims that local execution constitutes independent practitioner validation.

## Safety and evidence boundary

All canonical fixture content is synthetic and uses fake credentials. A passing corpus check does not prove universal provider correctness, arbitrary Claude Code compatibility, perfect redaction, production safety, native target resumability, or practitioner validation. It also does not turn a local peer run into independent adoption or production evidence.
